/**
 * Class responsible for deciding what transactions to request and, once
 * downloaded, whether and how to validate them. It is also responsible for
 * deciding what transaction packages to validate and how to resolve orphan
 * transactions. Its data structures include TxRequestTracker for scheduling
 * requests, rolling bloom filters for remembering transactions that have
 * already been {accepted, rejected, confirmed}, an orphanage, and a registry of
 * each peer's transaction relay-related information.
 *
 * Caller needs to interact with TxDownloadManager:
 * - ValidationInterface callbacks.
 * - When a potential transaction relay peer connects or disconnects.
 * - When a transaction or package is accepted or rejected from mempool
 * - When a inv, notfound, or tx message is received
 * - To get instructions for which getdata messages to send
 *
 * This class is not thread-safe. Access must be synchronized using an
 * external mutex.
